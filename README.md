This repository contains summary of the concepts learned in  Machine Learning:Classification by University of Washington on Coursera

Classification is at the core of most of the machine learning applications used in the real world. Classification problems take in input data and assign a category or class to it.  Some of the applications of classification are: spam filtering, personalized medical diagnosis, sentiment analysis, risk detection and image classification.
